Seedworld will implement distinct go-to-market strategies for Web2 and Web3 audiences. For the Web3 audience, our primary focus is to build a strong, engaging community that will continue to support our tokens and NFTs before, during and after the game's launch. This community will also enjoy the economic benefits our ecosystem provides through our gamified Web3 activities. For the Web2 audience, we will follow a more traditional approach to launching a Triple-A game. Our main focus will be to create momentum and interest through well-timed trailer releases, media attention, and community engagement. Last updated1 month ago
