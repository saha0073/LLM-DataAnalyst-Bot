Land NFTsin Seedworld are crucial assets that are intricately connected with nodes, forming a foundational element of the Seedworld ecosystem. Key Features and Utilities of Land NFTs: Distribution: Lands will be partially airdropped to existing NFT holders, driving demand for Mounts and Vanguards. The remaining lands will be sold for $SWORLD, the main cryptocurrency of Seedworld. Resource Generation: Lands generate resources essential to Seedworldâ€™s economy. These resources are highly desirable and tradable, making land ownership a significant economic activity within the metaverse. Resource Surveying:Players must survey lands using $SWORLD to discover the resources. This process ensures ongoing engagement with the currency and maintains the land's value and utility. If you connect your land to a node, your activity on the land will generate points for the node. Based on the points collected, the node will rank in a leaderboard and will receive various rewards. The rewards are then redistributed transparently to the land owners by the node owners (reward split known in advance). Last updated1 month ago
