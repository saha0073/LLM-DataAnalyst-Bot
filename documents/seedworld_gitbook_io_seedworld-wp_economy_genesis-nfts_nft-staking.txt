Join Seedworld's NFT staking program by staking The Mounts of Seedworld and Seedworld Vanguards to accumulate Seedworld Points, redeemable for $SWORLD tokens later. The simplified staking program lets youstake your NFTswithout worrying about gas fees. Instead of sending your NFTs directly to a smart contract, you soft-stake them and earn points immediately. Just remember, after you unstake an NFT, there's a 7-day cooldown period where you won't earn any points. Then, you can easily keep track of your earnings, staked NFTs, cooldown periods, and the total NFTs staked on your dashboard. Last updated1 month ago
