Seedworld is creating a sustainable game economy without inflationary mechanics. Players must collect all resources and craft all products. This creates a living marketplace where supply and demand meet and a savvy entrepreneur can make a good living by searching for opportunities. Even our in-game currency is created by players from the $SWORLD token. Everything in Seedworld needs maintenance, and therefore, various resources are required to keep machines running, prevent buildings from crumbling, and make swords cut rather than just tickle.
