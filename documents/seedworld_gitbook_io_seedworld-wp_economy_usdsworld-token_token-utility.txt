Utilities & sinks of $SWORLD: NFT & Cosmetic Shop Mints: $SWORLD is used to purchase lands and other future collections or cosmetics, driving value back to the token. Burns into Virtual Currency (Ame): To facilitate adoption, Seedworld introduces Ame, an in-game virtual currency. $SWORLD is converted and burned to generate Ame, which has a fixed price and is used for all transactions within Seedworld, such as buying and selling resources, services, items, and buildings. Web2 players can purchase Ame using their credit cards, but the system always buys $SWORLD first, ensuring constant demand, buying pressure & burning of $SWORLD tokens. Also, every in-game action involving Ame results in a partial burn of the currency, increasing the need for more $SWORLD conversions. Land & Node Upgrades: Upgrades to lands and nodes within Seedworld require $SWORLD, adding another demand layer through progression systems. Battle Pass Discounts: Seedworld offers a monthly subscription model similar to a Battle Pass, which can be purchased at a discount using $SWORLD. Players with a Battle Pass receive enhanced rewards and exclusive access. Last updated1 month ago
