Creator Mode in Seedworld offers an expansive and immersive platform for players to design and build their own unique worlds using an extensive array of terraforming tools and a vast asset library. Players can start their creations by selecting a basic island type, which provides a visually appealing foundation for beginners. Upon entering Creator Mode, players are greeted with a dynamic animation that immerses them into the creative environment, dropping their character from the sky like a god to land on the ground. For newcomers, a helpful popup offers video tutorials and links to comprehensive documentation, ensuring a smooth onboarding process. The core pillars of Creator Mode include a material library filled with a wide range of textures and styles, alongside powerful building tools such as an undo shortcut and a prefab gallery. These tools allow players to access and customize pre-built structures and decorations, modify placed prefabs, and adjust the camera distance for better visibility and creative flexibility. Interactive elements like the open door mechanism, which operates like a Jedi using the Force, and an automatic drop feature that places objects close to the ground, enhance the user experience. Terraforming tools in Creator Mode include alpha brushes for creating and modifying sand dunes, and other brushes to be determined, as well as tools for polishing and smoothing terrain. The erase brush removes height map data to revert the terrain to its default state, while small rocks along edges help suggest scale. The flatten tool benchmark and the ramp spline tool, which integrates ramps into the terrain, further expand the creative possibilities. Painting tools allow players to paint road materials directly onto the landscape, aided by a layer system that facilitates more efficient and detailed painting. Landscape features include the ability to add oceans, rivers, lakes, waterfalls, and dynamic particle effects, enhancing the natural beauty and realism of the created worlds. Additionally, Creator Mode integrates seamlessly with the marketplace, allowing players to monetize their creativity. They can sell their custom worlds, assets, and designs to other players, generating revenue by offering unique, high-quality creations that enhance the gameplay experience for others. This comprehensive and user-friendly mode is designed to be accessible for beginners while providing depth and flexibility for experienced creators, fostering a vibrant and dynamic ecosystem within Seedworld.
