Most features we are coding for Beyond The Keep, will be the initial base of the template system of Seedworld SDK. The comprehensive framework herein will be utilizable for many game genres, such as shooters, battle royales, RPGs, farming/crafting simulators and more. So that users can create many games in Seedworld by utilizing what we already developed here.

There will be a progression of new template modules we will be coding thereafter, often providing them with an already polished game experience, so that part of the work we do here, can be utilized to grow Seedworld, while we are growing our template database for people to create games easily.
