When we look at today’s online consumer habits, there is a certain pattern. User-generated content platforms have been transforming our habits. TV has been replaced by YouTube, and news has been replaced by X (formerly Twitter). Users are the creators now, and consumers love that. Entertainment, specifically gaming, is transforming via UGC Gaming platforms, too. Today, Roblox has more monthly average users than all the games in Steam and Epic Games stores combined. The opportunity is ever-growing, and Roblox is catering mostly to a younger age group due to its artistic style and community roots. The world needs a UGC platform for those who have grown with Roblox but want something deeper. Roblox has 216 million monthly users. Over 3 billion gamers worldwide love gaming, yet they have never used a UGC gaming platform because something wasn’t made for them yet. As user-generated content platforms keep replacing old habits, UGC gaming, which can become home to the whole world, with its art style, economic depth, and incentives, must be created. We are building Seedworld to become exactly that. We know that a UGC gaming platform that executes this goal will, at minimum, reach hundreds of millions of gamers by providing something new and unique via the use of Web3 tech. We see not only a multi-billion dollar opportunity but something that will change gaming forever at Seedworld. Last updated1 month ago
