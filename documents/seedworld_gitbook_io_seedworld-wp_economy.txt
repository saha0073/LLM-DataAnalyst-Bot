Our primary goal is to create a sustainable, circular, and realistic economy within the Seedworld ecosystem. We will achieve this thanks to the following pillars: The base of our ecosystem's economy is our token $SWORLD, and we utilize it in every aspect of Seedworld Our virtual in-game currency is created by burning $SWORLD, even when purchased with fiat, Our (new) NFTs, NFT upgrades and various in-game assets can be purchased directly with $SWORLD, Our subscription is available for $SWORLD, And all other aspects of the economy are connected to our token. While we try to separate Web3 and Web2 purchases for the common user with seamless crypto, $SWORLD remains the central currency driving the entire ecosystem. Each purchase of in-game currency & assets with fiat generates a purchase and burn of $SWORLD tokens on the market. Last updated1 month ago
