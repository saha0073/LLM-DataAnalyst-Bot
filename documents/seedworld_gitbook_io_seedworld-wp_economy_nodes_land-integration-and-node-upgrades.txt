Upgrading your node using $SWORLD tokens offers a range of significant advantages that enhance both functionality and reward potential. One of the primary benefits is an increase in Seed Points generation. As nodes are upgraded, they accumulate more points, which directly boosts the $SWORLD rewards earned. Additionally, higher-level nodes enable the connection of multiple Land NFTs. While a Level 1 node allows the connection of just one land, upgraded nodes can connect numerous lands. This expanded connectivity results in increased Seed Points, further increasing the rewards distributed to node owners. More connected lands mean greater interaction and activity, which translate into more $SWORLD rewards. Upgrades also allow for greater customization and gamification of the node itself. Enhanced nodes can accommodate additional structures and cosmetics, enriching the node’s interactive elements and personalizing its appearance. This not only adds a visual appeal but also generates Seed Points, also leading to a greater $SWORLD share of rewards. For those who own multiple nodes, the highest-level upgrades require merging nodes, creating an incentive for early adopters and long-term holders. This merging mechanism encourages a more strategic approach to node ownership, rewarding those who invest in and manage multiple nodes from the start. Integrating Land NFTs with Seedworld nodes is key for maximizing rewards. Connecting lands to a node significantly boosts its potential to generate rewards. When lands are linked, Seed Points increase, improving the Node's rank and thus the share of its daily $SWORLD rewards. This connection also benefits land owners, as a portion of the rewards is redistributed to them. Active participation on these lands—such as resource collection, construction, and other in-game activities—further enhances the rewards for both the node holder and the land owners. More connected lands and higher activity levels translate into greater rewards, creating a symbiotic relationship between nodes and lands. Node owners share rewards between themselves and land NFT owners. This distribution plan is transparent and can be modified by a Node owner with a 30-day notice, ensuring clear communication and adjustments. Land NFT owners can disconnect their lands from a node with a 15-day notice, providing them with flexibility in managing their involvement.  Land integration, along with voting on grants and incentive programs, creates a thriving, interconnected ecosystem where everyone wins: Builders & Creatorsgenerate income by monetizing their games and experiences.
