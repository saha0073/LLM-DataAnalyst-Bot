Resources come in different rarity tiers, which include common, rare, epic, legendary, and mythic. Each of these rarity levels affects the quantity you can collect and how fast you can collect that resource. Here's how it works: Rarity Levels: Common:These are the everyday resources that you can find in the common subcategories. Rare:You can find two Rare resources in every subcategory. Epic:You can find two Epic resources in every subcategory. Legendary:One Legendary resource can be found in each subcategory. Mythic:You'll encounter one Mythic resource in each subcategory as well. Impact on Collection: The rarity of a resource determines how much of it you can collect and how quickly you can collect it. Common resources are abundant and easy to find, making them readily available. On the other hand, rare, epic, legendary, and mythic resources are more challenging to locate and will require more effort to collect. Availability: Scarcer resources are harder to come by, and the rarer the resource, the fewer Resource of that type are available in Seedworld. Owning Land NFTs representing rarer resources can be a valuable asset, as it allows you to control and optimize your resource collection strategy. Every rarity tier comes with a predetermined base collecting speed. This means that, initially, each resource rarity type has a specific speed at which you can gather them. However, there's a twist to it: Collecting Speed Variability: While there's a base collecting speed for each rarity, the initial collecting speed for your resources is randomly generated based on this base value. Collecting Speed Reduction: When you actively collect resources, your collecting speed slightly decreases with each collecting action. This reduction doesn't occur gradually over time, so if you take a break from collecting, you won't be affected by a collecting speed loss. The combination of the initial speed, the speed decrease with each collection, and the total amount of resources attached to your NFT determine the time it will take to collect all the resources on your land. Enhancing Collecting Speed: To counteract the reduction in collecting speed and expedite resource collection, players have the option to increase their collecting speed through several means: Leveling up your profession. Upgrading your factory. Enhancing your machines. Utilizing game aspects with speed-boosting abilities. By investing in these aspects, you can effectively balance the loss of collecting speed and even significantly increase your speed, allowing you to gather all the resources on your land more efficiently.
