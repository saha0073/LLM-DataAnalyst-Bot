One of our most innovative approaches to widely accessible crypto gaming is our virtual currency - Ame. Ame is in-game currency, similar to gold or gems in other games. Unlike in other games, it is not sold by the company but created by players by burning a $SWORLD token. This gives the token basic utility and makes it long-term deflationary. Ame is pegged to the US dollar to prevent value fluctuations in the crypto markets and keep Seedworld's economy stable. By creating Ame, players use $SWORLD from their wallet or purchase it with fiat from the company that is used for: Permanent burning Reward pools Withdraw pool Revenue. Ame is always in demand as the number of players grows, but it is also used in the game as a resource and becomes locked in the system, requiring creating more of it. Players can convert Ame back to $SWORLD if they want to cash it out, but only via withdraw pools. Last updated1 month ago
