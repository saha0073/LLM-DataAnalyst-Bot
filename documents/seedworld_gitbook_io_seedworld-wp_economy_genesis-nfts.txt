All of Seedworld's NFTs have an active role in the game. Any NFT of the Genesis collections will grant their owners a free Seedworld Subscription if they have it staked. In addition, they grant players various benefits in the game. We still keep our promise not to make the game pay to win, so those benefits do not give owners extra power. Vanguards will unlock access to Amechemistry - a special profession only Vanguard holders can pursue and it allows them to manipulate Ame. Mount NFTs will grant players free blueprints for their mounts. And Lands generate the juice of the Seedworld - the resources. Last updated1 month ago
