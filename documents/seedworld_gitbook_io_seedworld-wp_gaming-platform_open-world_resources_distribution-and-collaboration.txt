As discussed in the preceding section, the collection speed in Seedworld is determined by a myriad of factors. From these factors, a daily collecting speed is derived, indicating the quantity of resources that can be gathered each day. These resources are not exclusively for the owner's collection; a percentage, denoted as X%, is designated for the owner, while the remainder is available for external users, players, or visitors to collect. Owners wield the ability to specify the tasks and actions that external users must undertake to receive a portion of the player's share or to unlock rewards from a pool managed by the owner. This dynamic introduces a collaborative aspect to resource collection, where players can contribute to and benefit from shared efforts. Owners and players share the resources collected by the players, with the owner determining the percentage allocated to players. The larger the share, the more appealing the land becomes to players, encouraging them to collect resources on that specific land. Last updated1 month ago
