 The Mounts of Seedworld are NFT companions in Seedworld, designed as vehicles. They are integral to the Seedworld experience and come in three distinct types: Bloodmother, Skyrider, and Deathrunner. Bloodmothers are steampunk spider-like cargo mounts available in three versions—four-legged, six-legged, and eight-legged—each with an increasing cargo capacity. Skyriders are giant, flying mosquito-like mounts. Deathrunners are small, fast-hound-like mounts designed for quick travel and exploration. Mounts will have various in-game advantages and can be used to join the NFT staking program described at the bottom of this page. Mount holders will also be entitled to receive future NFT drops (such as Land NFTs).
