Seedworld’s focus is on providing players with the tools needed to build their own gaming experiences and expand a Gaming Metaverse together. With our user-generated content (UGC) engine, users can create unique lands, deploy 3D assets, and produce amazing games with drag-and-drop features and frameworks without any prior coding skills… Our land builder, akin to Minecraft but in 3D, offers advanced tools for creating vibrant worlds and multiplayer experiences. Together they will help unlock a world of infinite potential for entertainment. While user-generated content will be at the heart of Seedworld, we will also publish our own curated game modes. The first of these is: "'Beyond The Keep'", which is an exhilarating survival shooter set to launch with Seedworld's Beta in February 2025. 

In this immersive third-person game, players will gather resources, build their base, engage in fierce combat to protect their assets against the raids of other players. The game seamlessly combines strategic planning, and competitive gameplay, while fostering intense social interactions and alliances due to full loot PvP and raiding mechanics. Players will strive to dominate real-time seasons, earning their place on a global leaderboard and securing valuable rewards such as $SWORLD tokens, NFTs, and exclusive skins in this first game mode. Aligned with our philosophy of user-driven growth, Seedworld will continually evolve through community contributions. This whitepaper will guide you through our vision, detailing how our platform will be expanding with its community, assets, tools, and core gameplay loops. Last updated1 month ago
