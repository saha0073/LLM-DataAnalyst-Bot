Seed Nodes are the gateway between the real world and Seedworld, creating a powerful bridge where virtual and tangible worlds meet. By owning a Node, you become an integral part of the ecosystem,earning perpetual rewards from every transaction that converts $SWORLD or fiat currency into Ame, Seedworld's in-game currency; providing a continuous stream of income.
The reward pool grows larger with every Ame purchase, increasing as more players actively engage in the game. Beyond the daily rewards from every Ame purchase or acquisition, 27.5% of SWORLD's total supply is additionally set aside specifically for node rewards. Also, the remaining unused tokens from the Burn to Swap Pool allocation (18% total) will be added to those 27.5% once the burn feature ends at TGE+6 months. The node allocation is initially determined by the number of nodes sold. For example, if 50% of the nodes are sold at TGE, node owners are entitled to 15% of 50% of the total allocation, at TGE. The remaining tokens are then allocated & vested among all node owners at the end of the 60-month vesting period (following the same logic). 
Simply put, the initial node reward allocation (vested over 60 months) will extend beyond that period. The reward distribution is dynamic and will evolve over time: Holders rewards:-> You are entitled to those rewards if you simply hold a node in your walletActive rewards:-> Node Owners are ranked based on the Seed Points they generate, and they receive $SWORLD rewards accordingly. 

To generate Seed Points, you can:
- Stake $SWORLD tokens in the various pools available Starting in Phase 2, additional methods for earning Seed points will be introduced. In this phase, Node owners can now earn Seed points by connecting their Nodes to active Lands while sharing a portion of their SWORLD rewards with Land owners. Holders rewards:-> You are entitled to those rewards if you simply hold a node in your walletActive rewards:-> Node Owners are ranked based on the Seed Points they generate, and they receive $SWORLD rewards accordingly. 

There are/will be multiple ways to generate Seed Points, such as:
- Staking $SWORLD tokens in the various pools available
- Connecting your Node(s) to Land NFT(s) In Phase 3, Node upgrade mechanisms are introduced. You can upgrade your Nodes to connect to additional Lands or simply customize them to your liking.

- Connecting your Node(s) to Land NFT(s)
- Upgrading & Customizing your nodes In Phase 4, external players will be able to visit Lands, gather resources, and craft their first items. This activity will boost Land engagement and generate additional rewards for the connected Nodes.

During phase 5, Node owners will be able to boost Land activity by voting to allocate grants to builders and creators, enabling them to publish games or experiences linked to the Lands.
